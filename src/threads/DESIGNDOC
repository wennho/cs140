---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

First, we check if the timer_sleep was called with a positive number,
and if it wasn't then we return immediatedly. Then, we disable the interrupt
handler, set a field on the thread (num_ticks_to_sleep) which records
how many ticks the thread is to sleep, and block the thread. At the
end of the function the interrupt level is set back to its original, 
as this is only reach when the thread is unblocked again.

In the interrupt handler, every tick we decrement the variable
num_ticks_to_sleep and check whether it has reached zero. If so, we wake up
the thread. We do not check whether num_ticks_to_sleep is negative, because
any thread that has not gone to sleep will get progressively lower numbers
for this amount as it decrements and we should not try to unblock a thread
that is not blocked (or blocked for a reason other than being asleep).

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?



---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

We disable interrupts before calling thread_block, which prevents multiple
threads from calling at the same time. The other things called only affect
thread specific variables or perform reads, which means we can't have 
race conditions.

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values

>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

If a thread has a highest priority and is running, it's not clear if we
should give up the running to another thread which is waiting but has
same priority. We used the rule that it always gave up the thread,
and this matches the behavior of the scheduler. Also, when two threads
which have not run have the same (highest) priority, it is not clear
which thread to run, so we ran them in arbitrary order.

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

We put as much cost of scheduling outside the interrupt context as
possible in order to reduce the interrupt latency. This will improve
performance for interrupt dependent programs, but in order to do so
we had to create a new thread with its own associated overhead.

If we had time, we would find a way to speed up computation of
priority checking, priority donation and thread switching.
Possible optimisations might include sorting the list constantly
instead of having to frequently check for the max value of priorities
waiting to run.


			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

Everything was useful!

>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

No, the assignment description was very helpful, thanks!

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

Don't know, we didn't use the TAs.

Nope.
